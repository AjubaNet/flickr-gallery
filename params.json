Open `includes/html/head.htm` and enter a sensible title for your new website and put it in the `<title>` tag.\r\n2. Open `includes/html/foot.htm` with your favorite text editor and replace my details and profile links with yours. Delete everything you may not want to publish.\r\n3. Open `images.txt`, enter the IDs of the photos you want to publish, each in a separate line.\r\n4. Launch your favorite web browser and navigate to `http://yourserver.com/flickr-gallery/generator.php`. This will parse your `images.txt` and build your website.\r\n5. Done! You should be able to see your site at `http://yourserver.com/flickr-gallery`\r\n\r\nRepeat steps 3. and 4. whenever you add or remove any images to your `images.txt`.\r\n\r\nDemo\r\n----\r\nI am using a slightly modified version of this gallery on my own website at http://jan-gerd.com.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\nThis product uses the Flickr API but is not endorsed or certified by Flickr.
